#Overview
The News API Fetch project is a lightweight web application that allows users to fetch and display real-time news articles based on a keyword or subject.
With a simple and user-friendly interface, users can input a topic of interest and get the latest articles with relevant headlines, descriptions, and links.

#Features

Keyword-Based Search: Fetch news articles based on the user-provided keyword.
Real-Time Data: Uses the News API to display the latest news.

#Simple UI: Minimalistic design for ease of use and accessibility.

#Error Handling: Alerts users if there is an issue with the input or API response.

#Responsive Design: The interface is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.

#How It Works
*Input Subject: The user enters a keyword or phrase in the input box.
*Fetch News: Clicking the "Submit" button triggers an API call to retrieve news articles related to the input.
*Display Results: The results are displayed in a card format with the title, description, and a "Read more" link for each article.

#Tech Stack
*HTML for structure.
*CSS for styling and responsive design.

*News API for fetching real-time news articles.

#Usage

#API Key
This project uses the News API. Replace the apiKey variable in the script with your own API key:

const apiKey = "e8f7c2a43fa54475b9cd9423f1cdbd79";

#Error Handling

If the input field is empty, the user will be prompted to enter a keyword.
If the API call fails or returns no results, an appropriate error message will be displayed.
